# PDF SERVING SITE

This is a project created for the purpose of giving my friends and I the ability to access shared pdfs. It was inteded to be used with a private server.

## Code Goals

This code was developed with the intention of utilizing very few dependencies. It uses vanilla React and vanilla nodeJS. In the future I hope to cut out React and never have to deal with node_modules ever again.
